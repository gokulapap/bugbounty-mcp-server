# Security Policy

## Overview

The BugBounty MCP Server is a powerful penetration testing tool designed for authorized security assessments. This document outlines security considerations, responsible usage guidelines, and our security policies.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Responsible Usage

### Legal Requirements

Before using this tool, ensure you:

1. **Have explicit written permission** to test the target systems
2. **Comply with all applicable laws** and regulations in your jurisdiction
3. **Respect the scope** of authorized testing
4. **Follow responsible disclosure** practices for any vulnerabilities discovered

### Prohibited Uses

Do NOT use this tool for:

- Testing systems without explicit authorization
- Causing damage or disruption to services
- Accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data without permission
- Any illegal activities
- Testing government, military, or educational systems without proper authorization

### Recommended Practices

1. **Start with passive reconnaissance** before active testing
2. **Use rate limiting** to avoid overwhelming target systems
3. **Test in isolated environments** when possible
4. **Document all activities** for audit purposes
5. **Report vulnerabilities responsibly** to system owners

## Security Features

### Built-in Safety Mechanisms

The tool includes several safety features:

#### Target Validation
```yaml
safety:
  safe_mode: true
  allowed_targets:
    - "*.example.com"
    - "192.168.1.0/24"
  blocked_targets:
    - "*.gov"
    - "*.mil"
    - "*.edu"
```

#### Rate Limiting
- Configurable requests per second
- Automatic delays between requests
- Concurrent connection limits

#### Logging and Auditing
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Timestamp tracking
- Target validation logs

### Configuration Security

#### API Key Management
- Store API keys as environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use least-privilege access

#### File Permissions
Ensure proper file permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 config.yaml          # Configuration files
chmod 700 output/              # Output directory
chmod 700 data/                # Data directory
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the BugBounty MCP Server itself:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security reports to: [apgokul008@gmail.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

### Information to Include

When reporting security issues, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Setup
1. **Use isolated environments** for testing
2. **Keep tools updated** to latest versions
3. **Implement network segmentation** for testing networks
4. **Use VPN or proxy** for anonymity when authorized

#### Data Handling
1. **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
2. **Limit data retention** to necessary timeframes
3. **Secure disposal** of collected data
4. **Comply with data protection** regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

#### Access Control
1. **Use strong authentication** for tool access
2. **Implement role-based access** control
3. **Regular access reviews** and deprovisioning
4. **Multi-factor authentication** when possible

### For Developers

#### Code Security
1. **Input validation** for all user inputs
2. **Output encoding** to prevent injection attacks
3. **Secure defaults** in configuration
4. **Regular dependency updates**

#### Testing
1. **Security testing** of new features
2. **Code reviews** for security implications
3. **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD
4. **Penetration testing** of the tool itself
